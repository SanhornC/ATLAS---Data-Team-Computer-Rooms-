# ATLAS---Data-Team-Computer-Rooms
Computer Rooms Dataset Data Cleaning Files for UIUC ATLAS - Data Team

## Overview
This repository contains data cleaning scripts and documentation for the UIUC ATLAS Data Team's analysis of computer room usage. The purpose of this project is to clean, organize, and analyze datasets related to classroom and computer usage to support informed decision-making for resource allocation.

## Repository Structure
### Folder and Files
- Each_class_use_percentage/: Contains scripts for calculating usage percentages for each class across the dataset.
- Hourly_User_Count(semester)/: Scripts for aggregating user counts per hour over an entire semester.
- Hourly_User_Count(week)/: Scripts for analyzing hourly user trends within a week.
- Type_of_User/: Scripts for categorizing users based on their type (e.g., student, faculty, staff).
- User_With_Class_Record/: Contains scripts linking users with specific class records for deeper insights.
(Please note that these files are only for data cleaning. The output files are analyzed with Tableau Desktop.)
